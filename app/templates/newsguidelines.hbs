    <h2 class='mt-4 font-extrabold'>What to Submit</h2>
    <div>
      <p class='my-4'>
        On-Topic: Anything that good hackers would find interesting. That
        includes more than hacking and startups. If you had to reduce it to a
        sentence, the answer might be: anything that gratifies one's
        intellectual curiosity.
      </p>
      <p class='my-4'>
        Off-Topic: Most stories about politics, or crime, or sports, unless
        they're evidence of some interesting new phenomenon. Videos of pratfalls
        or disasters, or cute animal pictures. If they'd cover it on TV news,
        it's probably off-topic.

    <h2 class='font-extrabold'>In Submissions</h2>
    <div>
      <p class='my-4'>
        Please don't do things to make titles stand out, like using uppercase or
        exclamation points, or saying how great an article is. It's implicit in
        submitting something that you think it's important.
      </p>
      <p class='my-4'>
        Please submit the original source. If a post reports on something found
        on another site, submit the latter.
      </p>
      <p class='my-4'>
        If the title includes the name of the site, please take it out, because
        the site name will be displayed after the link.
      </p>
      <p class='my-4'>
        If you submit a video or pdf, please warn us by appending [video] or
        [pdf] to the title.
      </p>
      <p class='my-4'>
        If the title contains a gratuitous number or number + adjective, we'd
        appreciate it if you'd crop it. E.g. translate "10 Ways To Do X" to "How
        To Do X," and "14 Amazing Ys" to "Ys." Exception: when the number is
        meaningful, e.g. "The 5 Platonic Solids."
      </p>
      <p class='my-4'>
        Otherwise please use the original title, unless it is misleading or
        linkbait; don't editorialize.
      </p>
      <p class='my-4'>
        Please don't post on HN to ask or tell us something. Send it to
        hn@ycombinator.com.
      </p>
      <p class='my-4'>
        Please don't use HN primarily for promotion. It's ok to post your own
        stuff occasionally, but the primary use of the site should be for
        curiosity.
      </p>
      <p class='my-4'>
        Don't solicit upvotes, comments, or submissions. Users should vote and
        comment when they run across something they personally find
        interesting—not for promotion.
      </p>

    <h2 class='font-extrabold'>In Comments</h2>
    <div>
      <p class='my-4'>
        Be kind. Don't be snarky. Have curious conversation; don't
        cross-examine. Please don't fulminate. Please don't sneer, including at
        the rest of the community.
      </p>
      <p class='my-4'>
        Comments should get more thoughtful and substantive, not less, as a
        topic gets more divisive.
      </p>
      <p class='my-4'>
        When disagreeing, please reply to the argument instead of calling names.
        "That is idiotic; 1 + 1 is 2, not 3" can be shortened to "1 + 1 is 2,
        not 3."
      </p>
      <p class='my-4'>
        Please respond to the strongest plausible interpretation of what someone
        says, not a weaker one that's easier to criticize. Assume good faith.
      </p>
      <p class='my-4'>
        Eschew flamebait. Avoid unrelated controversies and generic tangents.
      </p>
      <p class='my-4'>
        Please don't post shallow dismissals, especially of other people's work.
        A good critical comment teaches us something.
      </p>
      <p class='my-4'>
        Please don't use Hacker News for political or ideological battle. It
        tramples curiosity.
      </p>
      <p class='my-4'>
        Please don't comment on whether someone read an article. "Did you even
        read the article? It mentions that" can be shortened to "The article
        mentions that."
      </p>
      <p class='my-4'>
        Please don't pick the most provocative thing in an article or post to
        complain about in the thread. Find something interesting to respond to
        instead.
      </p>
      <p class='my-4'>
        Throwaway accounts are ok for sensitive information, but please don't
        create accounts routinely. HN is a community—users should have an
        identity that others can relate to.
      </p>
      <p class='my-4'>
        Please don't use uppercase for emphasis. If you want to emphasize a word
        or phrase, put *asterisks* around it and it will get italicized.
      </p>
      <p class='my-4'>
        Please don't post insinuations about astroturfing, shilling, bots,
        brigading, foreign agents and the like. It degrades discussion and is
        usually mistaken. If you're worried about abuse, email
        hn@ycombinator.com and we'll look at the data.
      </p>
      <p class='my-4'>
        Please don't complain that a submission is inappropriate. If a story is
        spam or off-topic, flag it. Don't feed egregious comments by replying;
        flag them instead. If you flag, please don't also comment that you did.
      </p>
      <p class='my-4'>
        Please don't complain about tangential annoyances—things like article or
        website formats, name collisions, or back-button breakage. They're too
        common to be interesting.
      </p>
      <p class='my-4'>
        Please don't comment about the voting on comments. It never does any
        good, and it makes boring reading.
      </p>
      <p class='my-4'>
        Please don't post comments saying that HN is turning into Reddit. It's a
        semi-noob illusion, as old as the hills.
