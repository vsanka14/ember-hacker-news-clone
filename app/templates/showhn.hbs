          Show HN is for something you've made that other people can play with.
          HN users can try it out, give you feedback, and ask questions in the
          thread.
        </p>
        <p class='my-4'>
          On topic: things people can run on their computers or hold in their
          hands. For hardware, you can post a video or detailed article. For
          books, a sample chapter is ok.
        </p>
        <p class='my-4'>
          Off topic: blog posts, sign-up pages, newsletters, lists, and other
          reading material. Those can't be tried out, so can't be Show HNs. Make
          a regular submission instead.
        </p>
        <p class='my-4'>
          The project must be something you've worked on personally and which
          you're around to discuss. See these tips about how to present your
          work.
        </p>
        <p class='my-4'>
          A Show HN needn't be complicated or look slick. The community is
          comfortable with work that's at an early stage.
        </p>
        <p class='my-4'>
          Please make it easy for users to try your thing out, ideally without
          barriers such as signups or emails. You'll get more feedback that way.
        </p>
        <p class='my-4'>
          If your work isn't ready for users to try out, please don't do a Show
          HN. Once it's ready, come back and do it then. Don't post landing
          pages or fundraisers.
        </p>
        <p class='my-4'>
          To post, submit a story whose title begins with "Show HN".
        </p>
        <p class='my-4'>
          Every Show HN appears on shownew. Once it clears a small points
          threshold, it will appear on the show page in the top bar.
        </p>
        <p class='my-4'>
          New features and upgrades ("Foo 1.3.1 is out") generally aren't
          substantive enough to be Show HNs. A major overhaul is probably ok.
        </p>
        <p class='my-4'>
          Please don't ask friends to upvote or comment. That's not ok on HN.

          Be respectful. Anyone sharing work is making a contribution, however
          modest.
        </p>
        <p class='my-4'>
          Ask questions out of curiosity. Don't cross-examine.
        </p>
        <p class='my-4'>
          Instead of "you're doing it wrong", suggest alternatives. When someone
          is learning, help them learn more.
        </p>

          When something isn't good, you needn't pretend that it is, but don't
          be gratuitously negative.
