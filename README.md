# hacker-news-clone

Development in progress ðŸš§

I'm building a hacker news clone in ember.js to learn the framework. Some goals I hope to achieve:

- Familiarize myself with the basic concepts of Ember:
  - glimmer
  - routes
  - templates
  - controllers
  - helpers
  - modifiers
- Write tests. Learn:
  - QUnit stuff
  - mock/stub wherever necessary
  - setup models using Mirage
- Use Embroider for building the app. Learn:
  - route-based code splitting
- Integrate SSR using Ember Fastboot
